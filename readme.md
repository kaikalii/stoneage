# Description

Chalcolithic is a datapack that lowers Minecraft's tech level and flattens progression.

High-temperature metallurgy is a lost art, and neither the player nor villagers are capable of it. Advanced equipment and blocks can only be found in the ruins of ancient civilizations.

# Quick Overview of Changes

- No crafting of iron or diamond weapons, tools, or armor - copper is king
- Many smelting recipes require a blast furnace
- Altered recipes for many things
- No crafting of minecarts, pistons, or hoppers

The recipe book will help you with new recipes!

## Modified Recipes

- Raw copper and gold smelt into nuggets rather than ingots, and they require a blast furnace
- A copper ingot is equivalent to 4 copper nuggets (down from 9)
- A copper block is equivalent to 4 copper ingot (down from 9)
- A gold ingot is equivalent to 4 gold nuggets (down from 9)
  - Gold ores drop 1-4 raw gold (up from 1)
  - Nether gold ores drop 1-3 nuggets (down from 1-4)
- Glass requires a blast furnace
- Glazed terracotta requires a blast furnace
- Many recipes that take string can take other items that are used to tie things:
  - String
  - Vines
  - Weeping Vines
  - Twisting Vines
  - Leather
  - Rabbit Hide
- Some recipes that previously required an ingot require either a tie item or a sticky item:
  - Brush
  - Saddle
- Flint and Steel can use raw iron instead of an ingot, but it requires kindling in the form of sticks. The more sticks added to the recipe, the higher the durability.
- Shields and crossbows can be crafted with a copper ingot instead of iron.
- Completely overhauled the recipes for:
  - Blast Furnace
  - Shears
  - Clock
  - Compass
  - Tripwire Hook
  - All lanterns
  - Lodestone
  - Map
  - Smithing Table
  - Cauldron

## Added Recipes

- Flint-tipped variants of wooden and stone swords, axes, and spears, which have Sharpness I
- String from wool or carpets. Has diminishing returns.
- Water bottles can be freely crafted to and from splash water bottles. These can be used to extinguish fires but cannot be used in brewing recipes for other splash potions.
- Flower pots can be freely crafted to empty milk pots, which can be used to milk cows and goats in lieu of buckets.
- Nametag

## Other Changes

- Copper pickaxes can mine all blocks that iron pickaxes can
- Iron golems are *clay* golems. They are made in the normal shape, but with clay blocks instead of iron blocks. The clay must be surrounded by mud. Clay golems drop clay balls instead of iron ingots.
- Remove buckets from loot tables
- Village chests contain copper ingots and equipment where they once had iron
- Village structures that generated with iron bars generate with copper bars
- Anvil Replacements
  - Nametags can be used on a sign to change the name
  - Enchanted books and nametags can be applied to equipment by holding the book or nametag in one hand and the equipment in the other and using the book or nametag. Armor must be held in the offhand to avoid equipping it instead.
- Torches thrown from a player's inventory will automatically place as blocks when touching the ground.
