# Description

Stone Age is a Minecraft datapack that alters the games tech-level.

High-temperature metallurgy is a lost art, and neither the player nor villagers are capable of it. Advanced equipment and blocks can only be found in the ruins of ancient civilizations.

# Quick Overview of Changes

- No copper, iron, or diamond weapons, tools, or armor
- No minecarts, pistons, or hoppers
- Altered recipes for many things

The recipe book will help you with new recipes!

## Modified Recipes

- Raw copper and gold now smelt into nuggets rather than ingots, and they require a blast furnace
- Glass now requires a blast furnace
- Glazed terracotta now requires a blast furnace
- Many recipes that take string can now take other items that are used to tie things:
  - String
  - Vines
  - Weeping Vines
  - Twisting Vines
  - Leather
  - Rabbit Hide
- Some recipes that previously required an ingot now require either a tie item or a sticky item:
  - Brush
  - Saddle
- Flint and Steel can now use raw iron instead of an ingot, but it requires kindling in the form of sticks. The more sticks added to the recipe, the higher the durability.
- Shields can now be crafted with copper ingot instead of an iron.
- Completely overhauled the recipes for:
  - Blast Furnace
  - Shears
  - Clock
  - Compass
  - Tripwire Hook
  - All lanterns
  - Lodestone
  - Map
  - Smithing Table
  - Cauldron

## Added Recipes

- Flint-tipped variants of wooden and stone swords, axes, and spears, which have Sharpness I
- String from wool or carpets. Has diminishing returns.
- Water bottles can be freely crafted to and from splash water bottles. These can be used to extinguish fires but cannot be used in brewing recipes for other splash potions.
- Flower pots can be freely crafted to empty milk pots, which can be used to milk cows and goats in lieu of buckets.

## Other Changes

- Iron golems are now *clay* golems. They are made in the normal shape, but with clay blocks instead of iron blocks. The clay must be surrounded by mud. Clay golems drop clay balls instead of iron ingots.
- Remove buckets from loot tables
